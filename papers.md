					<td><h4>Blockchain, a Small Techie Overview</h4>
					<blockquote>Blockchain is more a buzzword than a framework. Most of the people think to understand it or part of it, then propagate their beliefs to the people without any understanding of it. As a result, it ends up categorized as some mystical technology that nobody understands because of the propagated misunderstandings. This paper will try to help to overview what is Blockchain and help you to make your opinion about it.</blockquote></td>
